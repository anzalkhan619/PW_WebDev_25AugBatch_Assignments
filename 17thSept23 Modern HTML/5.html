                    <h2>Improved Multimedia Support</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML5 includes native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This allows for easier embedding of multimedia content directly into web pages.

                    <h2>Canvas and SVG</h2>
                    <p>HTML5 introduced the canvas element for creating dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D graphics. Additionally, HTML5 provides native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing for the creation of vector-based graphics that can be scaled without loss of quality.</p>

                    <h2>Enhanced Form Controls</h2>
                    <p>HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., email, tel, date) and attributes (e.g., required, pattern) for form elements. This improves the user experience by providing better input validation and easier interaction with web forms.</p>
