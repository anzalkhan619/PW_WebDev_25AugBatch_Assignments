Accessbility in the context of web development mean the use and practice of creating web pages in such a way that it is accessible
to everyone regardless of ability.

It makes it possible for differently-abled people (like low vision,handicapped etc) to access the content of our webpage by the use of clever design and inclusion
of proper semantic tags in our html structure.

Consider this scenario:
    A bus ticket booking website that is built with accessibilty in mind will be accessible by differently-abled people as well
    and they will be able to benifit from the service along with others.
